Description: Linear and nonlinear regression analysis common in agricultural science articles (Archontoulis & Miguez (2015). <doi:10.2134/agronj2012.0506>). The package includes polynomial, exponential, gaussian, logistic, logarithmic, segmented, non-parametric models, among others. The functions return the model coefficients and their respective p values, coefficient of determination, root mean square error, AIC, BIC, as well as graphs with the equations automatically.
